# MATLAB for UBC Mathematics

## About

[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is the *matrix laboratory* and is designed for efficient mathematical computing with matrices. MATLAB is an important computational tool used in the underguate program in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ubc.ca) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca). Our goal is to get students and instructors up and running quickly with MATLAB.

## Conventions

MATLAB commands to be executed in a script or entered in the command window are presented as a code block with a grey background:

```none
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
```

Output printed to the command window is presented as a code block with a white background:

<pre class="output">
ans =

    15

</pre>
